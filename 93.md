NIP-93
======

Profile Gallery
-----------------

This NIP defines curatable profile galleries that might be used across clients. The intention is that users might curate a gallery in their profile (or somewhere else) to show some of their visual content of choice, such as art, photographs etc. 

The purpose of this NIP is to define an event Kind for Profile Galleries. A Gallery entry is a Kind 1163 Event consisting of an `e` tag and an `url` tag. The `url` tag must direct to a media file (such as an image or video) that will be shown in the gallery. The `e` tag should direct to a note containing this media file. The `content` field can contain an optional caption.

Additionally, besides the `e` and an `url` tags, the event may optionally contain NIP94 File Metadata tags as defined in NIP94.



## Example

```json
{
  "content": "An optional caption of the image",
  "kind": 1163,
  "tags": [
    [
      ["e", <event id>, <relay-url>],
      ["url", <string with URI of file>],
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Recommended client behavior

Clients can filter kind 1163 events and show them ordered by created_at. Users might delete 1163 events and readd them later with another timestamp, so clients should consider that events might have been deleted. 

Users do not necessarily need to use their own images or notes for their gallery. Accounts could currate their gallery based of content from others.
